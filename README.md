# Music in the Big City

In the first project of the course, I was tasked with comparing the music preferences of users in Springfield and Shelbyville. This project includes instructions on structure, direction, and conclusions from Practicum.

To test some of the hypotheses and compare user behavior in the two cities.

The data for this analysis was obtained from Y.Music to test the hypotheses and compare user behavior in the two cities. The project was structured to follow instructions provided by Practicum.
